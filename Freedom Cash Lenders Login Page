A generous and helpful family member or friend could offer to help by providing a personal loan. This can be beneficial because a family member may not charge interest or ask for your credit score and may be willing to help without a lot of conditions.

But tread this sentence carefully: Borrowing from friends and family has great risks if you do not repay the loan. Stiffing a family member or friend leads to personal complications and emotional pain for the generous person who was willing to risk losing money.

The main rule on borrowing this way: Be absolutely sure you can repay the loan. Nobody wants Aunt Edna or Uncle Ernie cursing us under their breath.
