Credit card companies will offer tempting cash advance options, but be sure to study the interest rate and terms of the agreement for taking cash advances.

Many cards offer introductory 0% interest rate on cash advances for an “introductory period”, and this can be a good borrowing option. Basically, you are repaying an old debt at zero interest.

However, … and this is vital … be sure to repay the credit card advance in full and on time. With many card companies, missing a payment or not paying within the agreed time means all interest that had been waived to zero accelerates. Which means instead of a 0% interest rate, you’ll have 18% (or more) on the entire amount of the loan

Those credit cards that do not offer 0% usually have higher interest rates for a credit card cash advance, some as high as 27%. That rate should scare anyone away from borrowing from a credit card company, whose sole goal is to make money for themselves, even if it means hardship for you.
